### Purpose of Analysis

This analysis represents the data of 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors and who received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the study results which compared the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### Results of Analysis

The data shows that two most effective drugs are Ramicane and Capomulin. These 2 drug regimens were tested on most numbers of mice. 
A summary statistics shows that the treatment regime with Ramicane leads to slightly lower Tumor Volume (mm3). As a result, we can say that Ramicane shows a little better result than Capomulin. Analyzing Capomulin itself- we can indicate that there is a strong correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
